                <h4>Bio:</h4>
                <p>Dynamic, diligent, dedicated, and willing to work hard towards the goal.
                    Consistent and driven young person who is passionate about making a
                    change to society. Dedicated, enthusiastic and loyal. Meticulous researcher,
                    analyst, strategic thinker. Proactive with a focus on solutions. Attention to
                    detail and active listener. Great at following Instructions.
                    <br>
                    I hold a Bachelors degree in Microbiology and Biochemistry from the University of Kwazulu Natal.
                    I learned a lot with my time at UKZN, especially being dedicated to your studies an creating.
                    This has carried on to the software engeneering bootcamp that i am currenty studying with Hypeion Dev.
                    I am currently on my second month out of 3 months doing software engeneering with Hyperion DEV.
                    I am Thoughrouly enjoying learning software engeneering,
                    especially level 1 which was dealing more with python programming language that I feel i gravitated more towards and how easy it is to work with.
                    <br>
                    With my new found skills I hope to be able to land a job with a company that would not limit my growth but rather encourage me to learn more about coding and possibly persue a computer science degree to strengthen my skills.
                    I am a lover of knowledge and my passion has always been with the biological sciences so persuing post graduate degrees in the biological sciences is also in the pipeline.
                    My greatest dream would be to find a career where i can merge both software engeneering and the biological sciences to make the use of all my skills,
                    these would be disciplines sunch as bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics. designing software that would be used in these fields would bring me great joy.
